# An Optimized Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm
<div align = "justify">

This repository contains the source code for An Optimized Round Robin Scheduling
Algorithm, which aims to improve the efficiency of the CPU by optimizing the traditional Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm.

## Introduction
The operating system performs a wide range of tasks, including managing processes, memory, files, input/output, networking, protection systems, and command interpreter systems. Since the operating system is a system program and processes interact with hardware at runtime, process management is the most crucial function in these operations. As a result, we may infer that managing all processes is necessary for increasing a CPU's efficiency. We utilize a number of scheduling algorithms to manage the process. There are multiple scheduling algorithms for CPUs. But every algorithm has its own drawbacks and constraints. In this research, we proposed a new method for the round robin scheduling algorithm, which enhances CPU effectiveness.

## Objectives
The objectives of our research can be summarized as:

1.To optimize Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm for the efficiency of CPU.

2.To optimize average waiting time from traditional Round Robin Scheduling.

3.To optimize average turnaround time from traditional Round Robin Scheduling.

## Implementation
Our Enhanced Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm has been implemented in C++ programming language. The source code is available in the "source code" directory of this repository. It has been tested on various inputs, and the results have been compared with traditional Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm to evaluate the performance.

## Usage
To use the Enhanced Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm, you need to compile the source code using any C++ compiler. Then, you can run the executable file and input the number of processes, arrival time, and burst time for each process. The algorithm will calculate the average waiting time and average turnaround time for the processes and display the results.
